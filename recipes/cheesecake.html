    <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
    <p>This cheesecake is made with white chocolate as part of the sweetening process and creates a deeper flavor than with just white sugar.</p>
    <p>Raspberries can also be subbed with any frozen berries of choice.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Crust:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup chocolate cookie crumbs</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sauce:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen raspberries</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cheesecake:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups white chocolate chips</li>
        <li> ½ cup half-and-half cream</li>
        <li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make crust: Mix together cookie crumbs, melted butter, and sugar in a medium bowl. Press mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
        <li>Make sauce: Combine raspberries, water, sugar, and cornstarch in a saucepan. Bring to a boil and continue boiling until sauce is thick, about 5 minutes. Strain through a mesh strainer to remove seeds.</li>
        <li>reheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Make cheesecake: Melt white chocolate chips with half-and-half in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water; stir occasionally until smooth.</li>
        <li>Mix together cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time. Blend in vanilla and melted white chocolate mixture. Pour 1/2 of the batter over crust. Spoon 3 tablespoons raspberry sauce over batter. Pour remaining cheesecake batter on top. Spoon 3 tablespoons raspberry sauce over batter. Swirl batter with the tip of a knife to create a marbled effect.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool cheesecake at room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Remove cheesecake from the pan and serve with remaining raspberry sauce.</li>
    </ol>
